# **Afterpay: Case Study**
*By: Sam Remy*

## Overview and Origin

* Afterpay is an Australian fintech company founded in October 2014 by Nick Molnar and Anthony Eisen. Molnar, 22 years old at time of founding, was already a very successful entrepreneur, having built up the marketing strategy and online presence for his family's jewelry business while at university, ultimately becoming the top seller of jewelry in his home country of Australia. Eisen was the former chief investment officer of Australian holding company Guiness Peat Group.

* The idea for Afterpay was born from a very simple theory of founder Nick Molnar: "Millenials have a total aversion to credit cards," because - in particular - they can lead to compounding debt. He decided to build Afterpay as a way for consumers to purchase goods on a sort of 'layaway' basis that avoids interest accrual and is effectively free to consumers so long as they are able to pay off their loan (four interest free installments is the standard but other payment plans are also available). 

* Afterpay really took off in 2016: after having secured it's initial customer base and proven that the concept was viable, the company took to social media to encourage consumers to contact their favorite retailers and request that they offer Afterpay. Today is serves over 9.9M active customers and 55.4k active merchants.
 
* Afterpay is a now Publicly traded company listed on the Australian Exchange (ASX) under ticker APT. It has a current market cap in excess of $1.5bn. The company took in $25M in it's 2016 IPO and prior to going public, it had received significant private investment from the likes of insititutional investors and VCs Coatue, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, and Tencent Holdings.

* At its core, Afterpay is trying to enable seamless credit transactions between merchants and their customers. Less directly, they are improving trust between merchants and customers engaged in transactions with merchants, specifically those enabled by credit, by acting as intermediary between the two. 

* The company has built a two-sided marketplace that 
    1) provides a credit solution to consumers that do not have access or have not embraced traditional financing solutions (e.g. credit cards) 
    
    2) provides a platform for merchants to promote their lines and generate referral traffic 
    
    Trust is built on the consumer side by way of flexible and low/no cost financing options (vs. 20% APR for traditional credit cards).Trust is built on the merchant side by reducing the risk of customers ‘walking away’ from their debts, which has traditionally lead to write-offs and/or costly and time intensive collections. 
    
    Risks are mitigated by way of weekly late fees ($8/week, capped at 25% of initial purchase cost) and $1,000-$2,000 limits on the aggregate amount of goods that a consumer can purchase through the platform and have outstanding at any given time. 

## Differentiation
* Afterpay's product was quite novel at launch, but new entrants and increased competition/imitation from incumbant payment & lending companies has commoditized the business model to some extent. In my opinion, their differentiation lies within their **merchant network, social media presence, business model, and tech**. 
    * **Merchant Network:** With nearly 60k active merchants, the referral traffic generated through simple search queries quite literally pays merchants to be part of the Afterpay network - a self-reinforcoing dynamic that encourages existing merchants to retain their relationship and invites new merchants to join in. 
    * **Social Media:** relationships with platforms such as Facebook and instagram allows Afterpay to grow its consumer base through product partnerships and point of sale advertising. 
    * **Business model:** Afterpay generates ~80% of its revenues from merchants, which turns the traditional credit model on its head. This is a powerful differentiator as it directly grows the consumer client base, which in turn attracts more merchants to the platform and increases overall transaction volume. 
    * **Tech:** See next section    
 
## Technology 
There are a multitude of technologies which enable Afterpay to deliver its business. I list the most relevant ones below: 

* **Big Data and AI** - the company handles consumer credit checks by analyzing hundreds of data points, including a unique product-based underwriting which takes a look at consumer demand for a particular product and determines whether high demand or 'status' of the product is likelty to lend itself to fraud (one example might be a fraudster using Afterpay to buy a high-demand, luxury product, sell it in the aftermarket, and delete their Afterpay account wihtout ever making a payment). The company also uses customer payment history to determine creditworthiness - leading them to reject ~20% of all transactions but also limit their write-offs to <1% of sales. The also leverages purchase data across merchants to enable discovery-based shopping. Cross-platform referrals via platforms such as Instagram are enabled by the use of big data and AI to deliver targeted ads to consumers based on browsing history and App engagement. Additionally, Afterpay is using AI/ML to organize its receivables, rate risk, and calculate the discounts that are appropriate to purchase the receivables at each vendor. Having a relationship with the consumers via their app would in theory enable them to model out factors such as likelihood of repayment, timing repayment, and overall indebtedness of the borrower - all factors that contribute to the riskiness of the receivable. Machine learning is also integral in the Search Engine, descibed in greater detail in third part of this section.

* **Factoring** - this is old school financial ‘technology’ but a super important part of how this business model turns a profit. Factoring is a method of monetizing accounts receivable that has been utilized by businesses for centuries. The way it traditionally worked is that a company would bundle their accounts receivable and sell them to a lender at some agreed upon discount, providing immediate cash to the business and shifting risk to the lender, allowing them to profit once payment was (hopefully) made in full. In Afterpay’s business model, Afterpay plays the part of the lender, enabling retailers to sell them their accounts receivable so that they receive cash today, and Afterpay earns the differential between the full purchase price and the discounted price. When a consumer makes a purchase through Afterpay, they pay whatever the full retail list price is, so they are indifferent from a price perspective; on the backend, the retailer who made the sale forgoes some portion of the full price in exchange for cash today. Risk is reduced by transaction volume (i.e. betting on a single borrower to repay is a bad risk, but combining thousands of them becomes a more reasonable proposition).  

* **Search Engine** - Afterpay's 'Shop Directory' is an internally developed, searchable repository of nearly 64,000 stores and millions of products. Shop directory is available online and via mobile App and, similar to search engines like Google and Bing, is based on matching search strings to keywords and sorting them by relevance. The engine is powered by proprietary in-house algorithms that support matching and ranking, search-as-you-type, typo tolerance, data freshness, and human augmentation (e.g. provide a means for analysts to augment search queries by adding synonyms)

## Industry Landscape: Online/Mobile Lending
 
* The online/mobile lending space was, like so many innovations over the last decade, a byproduct of the technical revolution brought on by the introduction of smartphones in the mid-late 2000s and the growth and scalability of data science and AI. Online lending, crowdfunding/alternative finance, peer-to-peer payments, online marketplaces, e-commerce, and mobile lenders are all examples of innovations enabled by the scale and reach of smartphones and the power of the underlying tech. Lending in particular has undergone a great deal of social innovation with the emergence of microlenders and other demographically or ethically driven platforms. Big data and AI have improved or replaced rather archaic processes across lending - namely, the need for a consumer to throw on their best suit and walk into a lending officer's office at the bank.

    * Openpay
    * Sezzle

## Business Results & Impact 
* Afterpay is currently in high growth mode. With 650 employees across 8 cities worldwide, the complnay is currently operating in Australia/New Zealand, the UK, and the US. It is planning expansion into Canada in FY21.
* A few of the more relevant business metrics as of FY20 yearend:
     * 9.9M Active users
     * 55.4k active merchants
     * $11.1B annual purchase volumes 
     * 14.5m referrals 
     * 0.9% losses (as a % of sales)
* Afterpay is a clear global leader in the "Buy now, Pay Later" space, but far from the only company engaged in this business. They face increasing compepition from locally grown companies with strong toehold positions and momentum in thier home markets (Affirm in the US, Klarna in Europe), not to mention incumbant patyments firms with deep pockets (Paypal). The blockbuster IPO of US based competitor Affirm is a clear signal that there is a great deal of excitement in the space, which may bring in more competition. 
 
 
## Outlook & Recommendations
* Overall, I think the outlook for this industry is quite rosy, given the signifiant growth and adoption that Afterpay and other similar companies have experienced in a relatively short period of time. 

* In order to further expand its reach, I think Afterpay should place focus more on ‘experience’ purchases as opposed to just retail goods. Something that I thought was unique that their competitor Affirm does is partner up with subscription or pay-as-you-go services - namely, Peloton. I could also see partnerships with companies like Live Nation that associate more with concerts and sproting events. 

* I think humans generally and the millennial cohort in particular are far more wired to be impulsive when presented with experiences vs. physical goods.  Once the world goes back to ‘normal’, I imagine there will be a huge surge in demand for experiences such as concerts, sporting events, live group fitness/organized sports, etc. 

* I think Afterpay could lean on it’s existing tech as the service would largely be an extension as opposed to a new business activity.
